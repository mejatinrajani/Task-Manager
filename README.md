## Workflow

### 1. **User Authentication**
   - Users register with their email and password.
   - Upon login, a JWT token is issued for secure API access.
   - The token is validated for every API request.

### 2. **Task Management**
   - Users can create tasks with a title, category, and due date.
   - Tasks can be edited or deleted as needed.
   - Tasks can be marked as completed or pending.

### 3. **Progress Tracking**
   - The dashboard displays task statistics (total, completed, pending).
   - A progress bar visually represents task completion.

### 4. **Streak Management**
   - Users earn streaks by completing tasks daily.
   - Streaks reset if no tasks are completed for a day.
